# Who can build what?

## What even is production quality code?

In no particular order, probably
- properly describing its intentions
- very straightforward and boring
- integration tested
- conscious of big-O time complexity
- reviewed or pair-programmed
- formatted with an opinionated formatter
- linted using an opinionated linter
- logging errors (at least)
